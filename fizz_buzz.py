Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.
Hello CS1200, i'm faking a merge conflict.
hi from main branch
Here's the catch:

For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
"""
for i in range (1, 21):
    if i % 5 == 0 and i % 3 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else: print(i)
